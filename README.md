- 👋 Hi, I’m @aeontheory
- 👀 I’m a full time professional working in data analytics and data engineering. I have a strong background in SQL, R, and BI tools (Power BI primarily), among others.
- I have experience across value-based healthcare, social services, education, and grant-funded public health-related research departments.
- 🌱 I’m always learning and trying to round out my skills. I'm currently becoming more interested in tools like Python, DBT, and the development of ethical machine learning models.
- 💞️ I’m always looking to collaborate with projects and companies focused on using data to make the world just a bit better for everyone.
- 📫 Message me on LinkedIn if you would like to reach out: https://www.linkedin.com/in/kr-erickson/
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ The significant majority of projects I've worked on are the intellectual property of my employer at the time and I can't legally share them publically. You can find old projects
- from grad school on here though, and I may throw other more recent projects on here if I make anything in my spare time worth sharing.
